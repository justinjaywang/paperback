# Paperback

## Motivation

![Paperback screenshot](paperback-screenshot.png)

Paperback is a theme for Wintersmith inspired by the typography of printed novels, and informed by blog posts written by [Information Architexts](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/responsive-typography-the-basics/), among others.

## Features

### Scale and rhythm

Font sizes and spacings use the [3:5 single-stranded Fibonacci scale](http://lamb.cc/typograph/).

### Responsiveness

The site is responsive to two sizes, with a breakpoint just below a typical tablet portrait screen width.

## Installation

### Stylus

### Author metadata

## Next steps

- Ability to sort through tag metadata to generate a dedicated page for a particular tag.
- Author page that makes use of the author's bio metadata.
